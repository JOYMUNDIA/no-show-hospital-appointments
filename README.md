# No show hospital appointments
## by Joy Mundia


## Dataset

>     The dataset used in the project is the no show appointments csv file sourced from Kaggle. The data is based on the presence or absence to a hospital appointment in varying neighborhoods across Brazil. Various characteristics have been included such as patient demographics, schedule and appointment dates, named comobidities, and whether the patient was on scholarship, but to mention a few. The scholarship program in mention, is the social welfare program of the Government of Brazil, aimed at assisting poor families in Brazil.

    Investigations on how these characteristics may contribute to the absence to a hospital appointment, are at the projects main core. Firstly, are there more people than not, who do not show up for their appointment? Does the data show patterns of who is likely to attend or miss an appointment? Are Individuals on scholarship more likely to attend an appointment than individuals not on scholarship? What days of the week are people more likely to miss an appointment? What groups have been associated with higher rates of absentia, females or males, alcholics or non-alcholics, those with known health-related probelms, or a particular age range?

## Summary of Findings

> The Findings for the project suggested that generally 20% of Individuals missed their hospital appointment and this held true even when deeper dive into the individual categories was conducted. However findings showed, people are more likely to miss an appointment if the day falls onto the start of a week such as Tuesday or wednesday. This does not explicitly confirm that early week days are associated with higher absence as the weekends have little to none scheduled appointment dates.
> Astonishingly, individuals with known health problems such as; Hypertension, Diabetes and the Handicapped, showed an approximate 2-3% slight reduction in the number of missed appointments. While every category followed the 20:80 pattern, the SMS_received group on the other hand exhibited a different outcome. Individuals who did infact receive an SMS to attend an appointment, ended up with a larger percentage of absence, contrary to what should have been the normal outcome. In the normal outcome, it would be expected that the SMS message helped remind patients of their appointment and hence lower the number of those who miss their appointment.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> To better understand the influence that known medical conditions have on the absence or presence to a hospital appointment, relative counts were visualized.
